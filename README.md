# The Man Of Culture

A true Man of Culture AI assisted image tagger, personalized rater and suggester. It is currently in early development however it is already able to do some basic stuff. The AI-Backend is currently private, but I am going to make it public when it is finished.

My main goal is to everyone be able to have a personalized high quality neural network model representing their taste in anime pictures. This Bot is the front end of the nasty AI stuff, but it will be able to fully maintain the backend (sending new learning data, creating new user models, configuring feeds)

## Features that are working

- New image feed from sankaku
- Random Image feed from sankaku with search parameters
- Image tagging in specified discord channels
- Image rating in specified discord channels
- User feedback image rating collection in specified discord channels
- Manual user model retraining based on new rated images
- Scheduled user model retraining

## Features that will be implemented

Coming up:
- Rest API for non-discord related usage
- And many more

## Setup

After I published the AI-Backend repository, I will do a proper setup guide.
