# The Man Of Culture

A true Man of Culture AI assisted image tagger, personalized rater and suggester. It is currently in early development however it is already able to do some basic stuff. The [ai-backend](https://github.com/legekka/ai-backend) is now available, however it is being rewritten and still work-in-progress.

My main goal is to create an easy-to-use environment for everyone to get a personalized high quality neural network model representing their taste of anime pictures. This Discord bot is one of the frontend of the environment, made for primitive management of the AI-backend, but also the main place where the personalized image feed has been set up.

## Features that are working

- Image feed of the newly uploaded images on Sankaku
- Random Image search on Sankaku with search parameters and user rating limit
- Image tagging and rating in specified discord channels
- User rating collector in specified discord channels, for personalized model training
- Handling the automatized process of model retraining
- Scheduled user model retraining

## Setup

After I finish the [AI-Backend](https://github.com/legekka/ai-backend) and the [Webui](https://github.com/legekka/manofculture-webui), I will do a proper guide.
